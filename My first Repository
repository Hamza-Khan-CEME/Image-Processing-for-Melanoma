My first ever repository on image processing. 
The task was assigned to us during my MS course Image processing for intelligent systems.
Although it still contains a lot of bugs but it will serve as a starting point to solve the infamous Melanoma detection problem often given as assignment or project during master or bachelor's level.
Please contribute to this I am looking forward to new additions to the program.
